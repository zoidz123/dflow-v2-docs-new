# Submit Bid

The following is an overview of the bid submission process. This section will be updated with step-by-step instructions and code examples.

## Overview

To win the right to fill order flow of an auction, you need the highest bid in the epoch. All DFlow auctions are organized as first-price sealed-bid auctions, meaning you can not see the other existing bids of the epoch during the Bid period.

During the Bid Period, you can:

- Submit only one bid
- Resubmit bid, if a higher bid is desired
- Cancel bid

There is no limit on the number of auctions you can bid into. If you are taking delivery of order flow of the previous epoch, you can still submit bids into the current epoch of the same auction.
