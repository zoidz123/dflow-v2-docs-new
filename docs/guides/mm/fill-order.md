# Fill Order

This is an overview of order filling process. This section will be updated with step-by-step instructions and code examples.

## Overview

If you are the winning market maker of an auction epoch, you will receive the exclusive right to fill the underlying order flow up to the Notional amount or until the end of the Generic Epoch Delivery Period (or Genesis Epoch Delivery Period).

If you choose to not fill the orders, you will forfeit the bid amount and the rest of the orders will be routed to the Backup Liquidity Provider specified in the auction.
